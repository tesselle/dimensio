  abstract = {The scientific analysis of ceramics often has the aim of identifying groups of similar artefacts. Much published work focuses on analysis of data derived from geochemical or mineralogical techniques. The former is more likely to be subjected to quantitative statistical analysis. This paper examines some approaches to the statistical analysis of data arising from both kinds of techniques, including ‘mixed-mode’ methods where both types of data are incorporated into analysis. The approaches are illustrated using data derived from 88 Late Bronze Age transport jars from Kommos, Crete. Results suggest that the mixed-mode approach can provide additional insight into the data.},

  abstract = {Geometry in the simplex has been developed in the last 15 years mainly based on the contributions due to J. Aitchison. The main goal was to develop analytical tools for the statistical analysis of compositional data. Our present aim is to get a further insight into some aspects of this geometry in order to clarify the way for more complex statistical approaches. This is done by way of orthonormal bases, which allow for a straightforward handling of geometric elements in the simplex. The transformation into real coordinates preserves all metric properties and is thus called isometric logratio transformation (ilr). An important result is the decomposition of the simplex, as a vector space, into orthogonal subspaces associated with nonoverlapping subcompositions. This gives the key to join compositions with different parts into a single composition by using a balancing element. The relationship between ilr transformations and the centered-logratio (clr) and additive-logratio (alr) transformations is also studied. Exponential growth or decay of mass is used to illustrate compositional linear processes, parallelism and orthogonality in the simplex.},

Moreover, for 3-dimensional compositions the data structure can be visualized by contour lines. In higher dimension the MDs of closed and opened data give an impression of the multivariate data behavior.},

  abstract = {Compositional data (almost all data in geochemistry) are closed data, that is they usually sum up to a constant (e.g. weight percent, wt.\%) and carry only relative information. Thus, the covariance structure of compositional data is strongly biased and results of many multivariate techniques become doubtful without a proper transformation of the data. The centred logratio transformation (clr) is often used to open closed data. However the transformed data do not have full rank following a logratio transformation and cannot be used for robust multivariate techniques like principal component analysis (PCA). Here we propose to use the isometric logratio transformation (ilr) instead. However, the ilr transformation has the disadvantage that the resulting new variables are no longer directly interpretable in terms of the originally entered variables. Here we propose a technique how the resulting scores and loadings of a robust PCA on ilr transformed data can be back-transformed and interpreted. The procedure is demonstrated using a real data set from regional geochemistry and compared to results from non-transformed and non-robust versions of PCA. It turns out that the procedure using ilr-transformed data and robust PCA delivers superior results to all other approaches. The examples demonstrate that due to the compositional nature of geochemical data PCA should not be carried out without an appropriate transformation. Furthermore a robust approach is preferable if the dataset contains outliers.},

For multivariate outlier detection methods this implies that not the given data but appropriately transformed data need to be used. We use the isometric logratio (ilr) transformation, which seems to be generally the most proper one for theoretical and practical reasons. In this space it is difficult to interpret the outliers, because the reason for outlyingness can be complex. Therefore we introduce tools that support the interpretation of outliers by representing multivariate information in biplots, maps, and univariate scatterplots.},

  abstract = {Compositional data are nonnegative data carrying relative, rather than absolute, information—these are often data with a constant-sum constraint on the sample values, for example, proportions or percentages summing to 1\% or 100\%, respectively. Ratios between components of a composition are important since they are unaffected by the particular set of components chosen. Logarithms of ratios (logratios) are the fundamental transformation in the ratio approach to compositional data analysis—all data thus need to be strictly positive, so that zero values present a major problem. Components that group together based on domain knowledge can be amalgamated (i.e., summed) to create new components, and this can alleviate the problem of data zeros. Once compositional data are transformed to logratios, regular univariate and multivariate statistical analysis can be performed, such as dimension reduction and clustering, as well as modeling. Alternative methodologies that come close to the ideals of the logratio approach are also considered, especially those that avoid the problem of data zeros, which is particularly acute in large bioinformatic data sets.},

Moreover, its distribution in the case of normality on the simplex is developed.},
